      <li>1. In part 1, is it possible to solve the problem using a single "for" loop?</li>
      <p>
        It is possible to achieve with a single loop if you use if, else inside the for loop.
      </p>


      <li>2.In part 2, can we create what is known as an "infinite" loop within the condition of the "while" loop?
        Describe what would or would not be necessary to achieve this. Provide a thorough explanation of
        your answer</li>
      <p> Removing the exit condition in a while loop, will make it go on infinitely. If you take away the condition "numbertoguess !=="
      which makes the loop stop to print when the correct number is guessed, you would then just make the loop go 
      on forever.  </p>


      <li>3. Discuss briefly how quickly or slowly a computer might be able to compute this, considering the
        number of guesses and the time it takes. How does the program behave while it is guessing? Can
        the program perform other tasks concurrently?</li>
      <p>
        Creating an infinitely loop can make your webbrowser behave badly, and or crash. 
      </p>


      <li>4. Explain the relationship between rows and columns in nested "for" loops. Can we, for instance,
        change the order, considering rows to be innermost or columns to be innermost, or does this not
        matter?</li>
      <p>
        We can change the order. If we do this, it will impact the outcome of rows and columns. This is because
        the code is read line by line and will therefore print thereafter.
      </p>
