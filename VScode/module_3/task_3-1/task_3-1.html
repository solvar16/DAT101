      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 1, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>
      <p>
        When the wake-up time is later than seven or less, the program will print out  that i can take the bus to school, because i used the
        comparison operator <=7. When the wake up time is 8, the prior statement will be false, and therefore check if the next operator
        is true, which it is - it is too late to take the bus to school. However, i can take the train. if then none of the former statements are true, 
        it will print that i have to take the car to school. 
      </p>

      <li>Same as question #1. How ever the answer should now be different. Discuss the behaviour of part 2, What happens when the wake-up time is not 7 and what happens when it is exactly 7?</li>

      <li>Discuss the behavior of part 3, what happens when wake time is less than 7 or greater than 8?</li>
      <p>answered in discussion 1</p>
      
      <li>Discuss the behavior for part 4, what happens if the number is exactly 0, is zero positive or negative?</li>
      when the number it exactly 0, the value wil print is zero, because that's what i said it should print. Zero is "hverken" positive or negative.
